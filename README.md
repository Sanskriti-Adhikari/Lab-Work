## Python Basics Assignment

This section includes programs focused on fundamental Python concepts such as
file handling, functions, loops, conditionals, and object-oriented programming.

### Student Record System

- File: student-record.py
- CSV File: info.csv

Description:  
A menu-driven program that manages student records using CSV file handling.

Features:
- Add student records
- Remove student records
- Update student names
- Stores data permanently in a CSV file

Run:
python student-record.py

### Tic Tac Toe Game

- File: tictactoe.py

Description:  
A console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented using object-oriented programming.

Features:
- Two-player gameplay (X and O)
- Win and draw detection
- Game restarts automatically after completion
- Uses a class-based structure

Run:
python tictactoe.py

## Matplotlib Assignment

This section focuses on data analysis and visualization using NumPy and Matplotlib.

### Book Data Visualization

- File: code.py
- CSV File: book_data.csv

Description:  
The program reads book data from a CSV file, converts it into NumPy arrays, and
generates different visualizations.

Visualizations:
- Line plot of book prices over years
- Bar chart showing number of books per genre
- Histogram of book price distribution
- Scatter plot of pages vs price
- Box plot of book price distribution

Run:
python code.py
